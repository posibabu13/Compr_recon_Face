# Compr_recon_Face
The efficiently represented faces of images using PCA called Eigenface which now become a standard and a common performance benchmark in face recognition . PCA produced dimensionality reduction therefore, it is suitable to use for lossy compression, while retaining those characteristics of the dataset which contribute most to its variance . Many algorithms based on various principles leading to the image compression by reducing volume data of image . Lossy Algorithms are based on the image color reduction, but reconstructed image are obviously used for some applications. Color image is converted to gray-scale (intensity) image. The resulted image is reducing the data volume belongs to the most common algorithms
